Social Shopping Layer – VyronaSpace x VyronSocial
🚫 Traditional: One buyer → one order → one checkout.
✅ Vyrona: Multiple buyers → group cart → shared checkout → social rewards.

🧩 Core Concept: VyronSocial Rooms for Local Group Orders
🏢 What is a VyronSocial Room?
A digital group space, exclusive to people in the same locality or interest group (e.g., apartment block, street, office floor), where they can:

Discover nearby Vyrona-enabled stores.

Coordinate and combine orders from the same seller.

Get discounts by unlocking group-buy thresholds (e.g., ₹500+ combined = 10% off).

Chat, suggest, react, and shop together in real time.

📦 Example Scenario:
Apartment: "Kumarasamy Enclave"
Residents form a VyronSocial Room.
4 of them want to buy from "FreshDaily Grocery Store":

Name	Item	Price
Sita	2L Milk, Bananas	₹120
Raj	Rice 5kg	₹300
Asha	Biscuits, Butter	₹180
Vikram	Eggs, Juice	₹200

Total: ₹800 → 📉 Unlock 10% Group Discount

Delivery happens together → delivery fee split → coins rewarded based on contribution.

💡 Key Features of VyronSocial Rooms
1. 🛒 Group Cart Integration
Each participant adds to a shared cart from the same store.

Real-time view of total value & remaining for discount unlock (like "₹120 more to unlock 15%").

Each person pays individually for their items, but delivery is shared.

2. 💬 In-Room Chat & Notifications
Built-in chat window for coordinating:

“Anyone need eggs?”

“Let’s order before 5pm slot ends!”

3. 🏷️ Group Discounts & Reward Coins
Sellers can configure Tiered Group Offers:

₹500+: 10% off

₹1000+: 15% off

₹1500+: Free delivery

VyronaCoins earned on group thresholds → distributed fairly based on contribution amount.

4. ⏰ Timed Shopping Rounds
Optional "Order Window" setup:

E.g., "Next group order closes in 30 mins"

Builds urgency and shared participation.
